/*
    FACTORY PATTERN
    is one of most used design pattern in java. This type of design pattern
    comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the
    best ways to create an object.

    in factory pattern we create objects without exposing the creation
    logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common
    interface.
